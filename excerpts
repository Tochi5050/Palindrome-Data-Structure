This code solves the question on Palindrome. A palindrome is a piece of text that spells 

the same when written forward and backwards. For example:

- abcdcba

- mum

- deed

I solved this question iteratively, under 36mins at first trial, with a space and time complexity of:

- Time Complexity : O(n) - This is because there a loop that moves through the strings once, and doesnt repeat itself

- Space complexity - O(1) - This is because no extra space was created to solve this question.

I assume that this can also be solved recursively, but with a space complexity of O(n), because of the recursive output of code to the call stack. But also a time complexity of O(n).
